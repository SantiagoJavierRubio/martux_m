The show, aired daily, consisted of slides of famous Italian landmarks and less-known regional sites, accompanied by text commentary and classical music. Casalegno’s studio meticulously collected and cataloged thousands of Italian postcards. The dataset was employed to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, which in turn generated the visual content for the performance.\nThe performance was presented in the Festa della Republica Italiana in 2021, organized by the Italian Institute of Culture in Vienna.",

            "description": "“Controllo e divenire” is and installation by Martux_M and Bruno Palma. The work was presented in Rome between 2018 and 2019.\nIn Sanscrit the word \"mandala\" means circle and in the Tibetan culture it is used to represent the Universe, both exterior and interior. The making of the mandala requires starting the pattern from the very center to favor a gradual opening in an outward direction. In the Buddhist tradition mandalas are created with coloured sands to be then destroyed, a metaphor of the transience of things.\nFor its strong symbolic and evocative value the mandala is the image chosen by the artists to represent the evolution of the earth's climate change in the last 160 years. The image in motion which creates the mandala and, at the same time, shows the data of  the Earth's climate change from 1850 up to now through chromatic variations, is projected in a loop on a salt surface.\nFrom blue which expresses the status of natural balance, moving through the whole spectrum of colors, we get to red that symbolizes that boundary condition where the ecosystem is on its break point. In this way the chromatic evolution reproduces visually the changes the different areas of the globe have undergone through time, allowing an immediate and intuitive perception of global warming.\nIn order to highlight the fragility of matter and  simultaneously the urge to preserve it, like in a kaleidoscope the images of the mandala turn into the four natural elements -fire, air, water and earth- , in which every substance that constitutes matter  originates. Love and discord rule them in a continuous cycle like a breath. The former keeps them together in harmony within a sphere, the latter destroys them and takes them into chaos.\nSo in this work, the four elements that come alive on the salt surface, the element both of preservation and cooling par excellence, realize a symmetrical dance opposing the darkness of death. The sound of the installation is composed only of the sounds of the four elements, sampled and organized in space as in a choral singing, which finds, in a fragile balance, the auditory essence of the world. \nTo trust the world also means  to give life to the creation of new space-time dimensions, to create a rebel art that urges and imposes an undelayable action on our conscience.\nText by Anna Cestelli Guidi",

            "description": "\"X-Scape Project\" is a multimedia experience that engages different senses through video and sound. In this audiovisual performance the opposition between material and immaterial is overcome by a labyrinth of light, space, emptiness, and complex vibrations.\nThe video design was made by Mattia Casalegno.\nIt was presented at the International Festival of Contemporary Music (Venice) and Digital Life Festival (Rome).",
