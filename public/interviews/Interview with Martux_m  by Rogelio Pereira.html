		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Interview with M. Martusciello by Rogelio Pereira</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When did your interest in concrete music begin?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: It started around the 1990s, a time when my musical experiences (rock, jazz, etc.) had reached a stalemate. I remember with what naive enthusiasm the discovery of concrete music revitalized the possibility of continuing, in a new and dynamic form, an experience with the world of sound through a completely new modality. Until then, my relationship with recording had been limited to documenting a sound event. From that moment on, recording became this &quot;formless principle&quot; that, when manipulated, edited, and fixed onto a medium, became a &quot;body&quot; imposing itself in a hidden, transcendent compositional principle that is not inherently audible.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You have always been associated with rock, jazz, improvised music, and electroacoustic music, where polyrhythms and opposition of elements are dominant notions in the development of pieces. What role does intuition play in all this?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: To seek an imaginable in imagination, an unthinkable in thought, to give life to a hybrid thought capable of holding together concept and sensation, truth and horror, spirit and body. A place of metamorphosis and transformation, a place where one cannot linger for more than an instant, a landscape with frayed and mutable boundaries.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Most of your performances involve interaction between various electronic equipment that you often modify and reconfigure. Amplification plays a major role in distributing sounds through speakers. How do you conceive all of this regarding time and space?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: This dislocation, this desituation frees the shadow that dwells in the sound body, which is its soul, and takes on a life of its own from the horrendous clots of blood and humors, in the filth of the womb, which like the speaker, prolapses to form a &quot;glorious body.&quot; A fluctuating time, fluctuating lines, the Aion opposed to Cronos, &quot;a clock that produces variable speeds.&quot; The obsessive search for that place, or &quot;non-place,&quot; where life and death touch, where there is all the meaning of our existence, to understand the point of intersection of the timeless with time, which, as Eliot says, is the occupation of saints.</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Compared to acoustic sounds, you usually obtain samples of these and then process them in your home studio; loops and sampled sounds have given the main structure of the pieces. How much space do you leave for improvisation?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Improvisation belongs to that space of &quot;beginning&quot; without knowing where the thing began and where it might lead, if beginning did not always and in any case mean continuing. We are a mass, an interweaving of stories, and improvisation makes the handful of dust I hold in my hands become a home again, a landscape, a face that once smiled at me, and that had disappeared into the oblivion of the past. Pushing further, ensuring that the sound-meeting penetrates and corrupts everything, undermining being, making it falter. Sound-bodies colliding, cutting, penetrating. Relationships between unformed elements, relatively unformed, of movements and stillness, of speed and slowness; sound molecules or particles composing themselves carried by flows.</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How do you conceive your relationship with electronic instruments through the computer?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: The disruptive desire that turns to objects and makes them lovable. This is Eros. But it is always about intersecting things, never reducing them. A cartography, never a symbolism.</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In your musical work with Elio (Meta-Harmonies, Inside), you develop many ways of making sounds using objects and electronic instruments. I guess (hypothesize) that this fact is related to experiences in other artistic fields such as visual arts?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: I had never had experiences in other artistic fields at the time of Meta-Harmonies and Inside. So my different ways of operating in the genesis of sound in those works depend on something else. Some of the motivations can be found in my response to your previous question, in that embrace that leads to every foreign land, and in the loss one proceeds forward, like dogs desperately digging the ground.</span></p><ol start="7" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your work &quot;unsettle line&quot; is a piece on the relationships between music and languages composed starting from texts inspired by the poetic work of Claudio Mutini. Texts that suggest certain images. How do you perceive the visual and auditory aspects of this piece?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Multiple singularities; fluctuations that form like figures on the crest of waves. Mobile and communicative singularities that penetrate into each other through an infinity of degrees, an infinity of modifications. An increase in sensoriality: sensations of matter; speed of movement: uncoded elements of languages. A disturbing interzone between impure cinema and sound architectures, crossings, displacements, in search of desiring tensions, a sexualized encounter that severs dualisms, remixes differences, relocates concepts. A fascinating world where the identity of the self is lost, not for the benefit of the identity of the one or the unity of the whole, but for the benefit of an intense multiplicity and a power of metamorphosis.</span></p><ol start="8" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It could be said that it is in live performances, in front of an audience, that you have to develop all this sound arsenal that you use freely... Moving music where experimentation prevails, using objects, electric motors, and conventional instruments, managing to obtain a wide range of timbres and intensities structured in a complex way. Is your interest here?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Exactly. It is the state of what must be called &quot;complicatio&quot; against &quot;simplificatio.&quot; Sound-bodies are languages because essentially they are &quot;flexion,&quot; bodily flexion liberated from everything that ordinarily hides it. Bringing forth such an image is power, the impact of copulation. Lines of articulation, segmentarity, layers, territoriality; but also lines of flight, movements of deterritorialization, comparative speeds, viscosity, contractions, spasms, precipitations and ruptures, action on bodies of invisible forces. Sound-bodies suspended in hesitation that develop all the senses of disjunction. Disjunctive articulation, where sound-bodies contain a hidden language, the most abstract argumentation.</span></p><ol start="9" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="9"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Every sound can be composed and recomposed thanks to mixing on stage. How do you develop this task in the studio?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Exactly the same way, but with a completely opposite space-time relationship. On stage, your relationship with time is chronological; everything that is born lives parallel to your experience in that segment of your life, like an encounter. In the studio, it is completely different; making time sensitive, making it audible, eternal. It is an immeasurable task, beyond any time or cadence.</span></p><ol start="10" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="10"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What differences do you find between your way of playing electronic music live (in front of the audience) and in real-time (played live in a recording studio)?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Live, you open by appealing to the complicity of the audience; you are in direct contact with &quot;the other.&quot; Everything coexists and intertwines in an arabesque where everything is present in a loving and erotic embrace. In the recording studio, playing live with the absence of an audience becomes just a strategy, a technique for producing sound worlds, in a communication subtracted from the laws of exchange in any case, an asymmetric relationship.</span></p><ol start="11" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="11"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In your performances, a connection is established between equipment, instruments, and programs, relationships of elementary sounds which, in the computer&#39;s memory, are represented by text documents, silences, and noises considered as musical syntagms. How do you use them in your musical elaborations?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: All this constitutes a concatenation that makes it an organism, a significant totality, a body without organs that transmits directly&mdash;avoiding any expedient&mdash;on the nerve wave, in living flesh. Disjunctive articulation, where sound-bodies contain a hidden language. Plane of longitude and latitude, which opposes a plane of organization: &quot;Flatness, Rhizosphere, Hypersphere.&quot;</span></p><ol start="12" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="12"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is the typical relationship when you collaborate with artists exploring different sound areas?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: By not working together but in between, negotiating. Never finding oneself on the same wavelength, but always slightly shifted, in a parallel evolution, where each deterritorializes in the other. To steal; as I hope all the others do with me.</span></p><ol start="13" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="13"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Is it in live concerts, collaborating with other improvising musicians, that you reach your highest level of exploration in the moment of creation?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: No, it is not like that at all. As I mentioned earlier, live there is a completely different condition than in the studio, just as it is entirely different to improvise with other musicians or alone, or to work in the studio instead of on stage. These are all binary situations but none has primacy over the others. In each of these conditions, I express something different, and to this day, none of my works has supremacy as the top of the class.</span></p><ol start="14" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What do you think about sound artists meeting in a certain space to discuss experiences and give electroacoustic concerts, sound art, electronic music, and new music? To what extent do these help make future projects more concrete?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: I don&#39;t believe in this type of meetings; in my opinion, these exist only for reasons of convenience. All these definitions are formalizations, slogans only for power apparatuses. The problem does not lie in defining or categorizing what one is doing; in this way, the spectacle&#39;s managers&mdash;the undertakers of art&mdash;are favored. We must abandon all forms of solid concept: electroacoustic, sound art, new music, etc., are solid binary definitions; we must proclaim the death of every form of dominion that seeks to impose order and authority of one over the other. We must uproot every root and build sexed paths of dislocation of every discipline, of every method.</span></p><ol start="15" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="15"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is your opinion on improvised music played in Europe at the moment?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: I don&#39;t know what you mean by improvised music, whether improvised music as a sound processing technique, or if you refer to a very specific aesthetic. As a technique, I believe it is practiced more or less in the same way as it was practiced in the past, but certainly, one cannot say that there is a new improvised music. This, I believe, depends above all on a condition that has radically changed. You know, our societies are increasingly alienating what are the universes of value, and by this I mean constellations of values, heterogeneous and singularizing. Improvisation as an aesthetic is a cultural expression on the verge of extinction. Unfortunately, in a society where market laws are increasingly shifting towards establishing common opinion and more retrogressive power forces, improvisation becomes one of those disappearing spaces, which clearly remains an aesthetic paradigm that goes in the opposite direction. This means that it is increasingly difficult for me to find a replacement for historical groups and musicians of the improvisational scene, which can bring new aesthetic mutations like those of Evan Parker, Derek Bailey, or Han Bennink.</span></p><ol start="16" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="16"><span class="csCF6BBF71">With whom do you feel comfortable sharing the stage? Do you think listener involvement is crucial in your concerts?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Sharing the stage is sharing a space of life, a space of time. It is a space-time where creating a &quot;disjunctive articulation&quot; is essential; thus, an essential relationship emerges, where one exercises our active conduct towards reflexes, echoes, and doubles, to collect them and to evoke them, to give rise to a multiplicity. Clearly, in a concert, the relationship with the listener is a fundamental concatenation, constitutes a necessary reason.</span></p><ol start="17" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="17"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Could you please tell us about your work in the Metaxu and Z.e.l.l.e. projects? Where do you usually find your inspiration?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A: Metaxu and Z.e.l.l.e. are very different projects, but both involve friendships and music. What matters in these projects is not working together but working in between because for something to happen, there must be a potential difference, two levels, and then something happens. It is not about having the same ideas but understanding each other without needing to explain oneself. It&#39;s about having a common language, or better yet, having a pre-language in common. An evolution in parallel, producing something that is found neither in one nor in the other, to realize a multiplicity. Deterritorializing oneself in the other, reinventing alterity, in a relationship of fascination; I have stolen from them as I hope they have done with me.</span></p><ol start="18" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6" value="18"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is the future of your next publications? Will you continue to be faithful to your electroacoustic and experimental concepts?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I don&#39;t know yet what my next publications will be; I have recently completed a new CD under the name Dogon together with Massimo Pupillo from Zu and Filippo Paolini, then there is my very latest electroacoustic work &quot;Dissectio&quot; composed in the G.E.M.A. studios in Albi, with which I am working for its publication. You ask if I will remain faithful to my electroacoustic and experimental concepts; with the concept of fidelity comes that of betrayal, and I feel like telling you that empiricists are not theorists but experimenters; they never interpret, they have no principles, every experimenter must be a traitor, who does not seek something to conquer or an established order but to create, then disappear, become unknown, lose one&#39;s identity, one&#39;s face, seek the anomalous, which is always found on the frontier, on the edge of a chasm.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
