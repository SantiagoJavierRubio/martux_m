		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The &#39;encounter takes place on a parallelism between the present body and acousmatic body on a reflection of one in the other, double transgression: Sound by flesh and flesh by sound to produce a machine of sensation, creator of perceptions wrested from perception, of affections uprooted from feeling, of sensations alienated from common opinion.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Creating a &ldquo;disjunctive articulation&rdquo; , a hidden language, where of affections shift, of becoming catapult.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is not about talking about bodies but forming a &ldquo;glorious body&rdquo; &ldquo;nothing is more verbal than the excesses of the flesh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Bodies suspended &ldquo;in hesitation&rdquo; developing all the senses of disjunction.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pure vision of reflections that multiply what they reflect and give more intense participation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the function of sight is to double, to split, to multiply, that of the ear is to resonate, to make resonate.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Then emerges the essential relationship, the complicity of sight with listening, to seek what is the object of an oblivion of memory, of an imaginable in imagination, of an unthinkable in thought , expressing all doubles, the highest simulacrum.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To exercise our active conduct toward reflections, echoes and doubles, to collect them and to arouse them, to make multiplicity arise.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have long known that bodies speak bodies are capable of gestures that hint at the opposite of what they indicate &ldquo;of solecisms,&rdquo; its ambiguous secret , its &ldquo;suspended gesture&rdquo; the disjunction, the disjunct syllogism .</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But also the common element , reflection , bodies are languages because they are essentially &ldquo;flexion&rdquo; the bodily flexion freed from all that ordinarily conceals it .</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To bring forth the image such is the power, the shock of copulation, an internal narrative of bodies....</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The opposition of the exchange runs through all our work, it is no longer about similar things , it is not even about identity, but about the authenticity of the different .</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The intensity of the different , the double, the reflection, the simulacrum that opens to reveal its secret, to make way for the rich system of intensities.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Making an event of it, meeting on the theme of &ldquo;language bodies&rdquo; where the identity of the self always refers back to the identity of some thing outside of us, to signify that each thing opens up to infinity - of the predicates through which it passes on condition of losing its identity as concept and as self.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Of multiple singularities; fluctuations that include within themselves the unequal or the different.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mobile and communicating singularities that penetrate each other through an infinity of degrees, an infinity of modifications.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fascinating world in which the identity of the self is lost, not for the benefit of the identity of the one or the unity of the whole, but for the benefit of an intense multiplicity and a power of metamorphosis - it is the state of what must be called &ldquo;complicatio &lsquo;versus &rsquo;semplificatio.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Forming the androgyne or Prince of modifications who opens himself to his own difference and to all other differences.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The difference in itself, the unequal in itself that penetrates all others through and into the multiple bodies.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That everything is &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; that I am another, that something else thinks in us, in a multiplication that is that of the body, this is the joyful message, &ldquo;We never know for sure whether it is not others who think in us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Discovering a purely expressive or &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; value: A pure expression, pure emotion.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The great imperative of this encounter is found in fixing oneself in the very place of change, to place oneself on boundaries that open to &ldquo;other,&rdquo; to evoke an expressive value that does not possess a body without multiplying it in the system of reflections and that does not inspire sounds without projecting it in the intensive system of resonances; to revoke a bodily uniqueness, to re-describe the itinerary of one&#39;s &ldquo;feeling,&rdquo; whose first concern is not to define the thing heard or seen, but to attempt to penetrate its mystery, its unquestionable complexity.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
