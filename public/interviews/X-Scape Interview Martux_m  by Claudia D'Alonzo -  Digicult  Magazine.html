M.M. The X-Scape project comes from a long gestation period, everything always starts from a desire; the desire to break out of a language and we are within the language and the language creates faults, it is made only of black holes, of faults. This is where the desire for X-Scape comes from, to let the signifiers speak, to let them go, to be spoken by them, to finally be out of the obvious. &quot;Desire&quot; as the secret of seduction, because something must be missing before it is fulfilled. To bring forth the image is the power, the impact of copulation. And from this, my first audiovisual work titled X-Scape was born, with the precious collaboration of Mattia Casalegno, who enriched and exceptionally developed this first project of mine. To finally build an art that is unbreathable, that is no longer consolatory, that no longer has the whore&#39;s mask of consolation, that no longer has the decorative aspect, and to be able to do this, one must forget who they are, lose all identity, leave every premise in oblivion. Then emerges the essential relationship, the complicity of sight with listening, to search for what is the object of oblivion of memory, of an imaginable in imagination, of an unthinkable in thought. The subsequent idea to all of this was to produce a DVD, a de-writing of all the work done in the live shows, so no longer forms, but cinematic relationships; no longer subjects, but dynamic individuations without a subject, which constitute collective concatenations, a plan of longitude and latitude, which opposes a plan of organization, to create interludes that are focal points of creation, to be a stranger in one&#39;s own language.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Martux:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> _How did you structure the journey of the DVD? It seems to me that there is a crescendo of complexity both in terms of sound and video... M.M. &quot;Complicatio&quot; against &quot;simplificatio&quot;, certainly, In Western societies, market laws have increasingly shifted towards a direction in which common opinion and more retrograde power forces are implanted; new experimental arts today must pose the problem of how to escape and refuse to be the manifestation, the sign, governed by show managers, by the &quot;gravediggers of art&quot; as the Situationists said, who in the great apparatuses of consensus are capable of uniforming every difference and repressing every language of opposition. To counteract all this, one must think in terms of network systems (x-scape) that bypass states, globalizing policies, uniformity of opinions, build a level of complexity where different existential creativities can continue to exist, escaping a sort of generalized program that completely cancels out every possibility of bifurcation and singularization.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Martux:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> _In the beautiful packaging of the DVD, there are prints in which Deleuze is cited. How has this author influenced the concept of Xscape? M.M. Foucault said: &quot;One day, perhaps, the century will be Deleuzian,&quot; and Gilles Deleuze has left us a great legacy through his thought. X-Scape starts from his ideas of &quot;resistance&quot;, where art represents that unique creative force capable of changing our political and social conditions. Our societies are increasingly alienating what are the universes of value, and by this I mean constellations of values, heterogeneous and singularizing. Values are replaced by racism, xenophobia, violence; the pernicious nature of a homogenization of capitalist values is clearly seen. In Western societies, market laws have increasingly shifted towards a direction in which common opinion is implanted, More and more homogenizing ideas have invaded our lives, in our living rooms, in bedrooms; the world of advertising, the department stores in our cities, impose taste on us, uniformity, impose every accessory to make us habitual, to then organize our lives, Deleuze through his creative thinking, has ripped from philosophy its pretension to be epistemic, and has made it become creation of concepts, he has taught us that what matters is above all the enunciative root of creation and that aesthetic creation goes to put its foot in the door to everything that can be dominated by the programming of values of the capitalist system. He taught us that the only way to &quot;resist&quot; is to be in a &quot;guerrilla&quot;, and that aesthetic practice is one of these creative possibilities to prevent being erased like words written in the sand.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 28.25pt left 56.65pt left 85pt left 113.3pt left 141.65pt left 170.05pt left 198.35pt left 226.75pt left 255.1pt left 283.45pt left 311.75pt left 340.1pt;"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 28.25pt left 56.65pt left 85pt left 113.3pt left 141.65pt left 170.05pt left 198.35pt left 226.75pt left 255.1pt left 283.45pt left 311.75pt left 340.1pt;"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
